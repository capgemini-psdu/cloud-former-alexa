## About us
We are the Capgemini 2017 Summer interns based out of Capgemini's Telford office, 
our placements lasted a total of 8 weeks within which we developed a fully functioning Alexa skill, 
capable of managing and creating Cloud Infrastruture within AWS.

We've also written a [blog](https://www.google.com) about our time at the company and the processes we followed to complete this project

## Project Overview
We have maintained two seperate version of the code written in nodeJS and python respectively, 
the features for both are near enough identical, with the only major thing differing being the implementation and libraries used.
